# LEAP Examination App

## About the Project

Welcome to my personal project, the **LEAP Examination App**! I'm Ojas Gupta, and I'm thrilled to introduce this lockdown kiosk application that I've developed to create a secure and controlled environment for examinations.

The LEAP Examination App is designed to ensure that users can access only the designated examination interface, preventing unauthorized access to other functions on Windows devices. It's a powerful tool to maintain the integrity of the examination process.

## Key Features

- **Lockdown Kiosk Mode**: The LEAP Examination App locks down Windows devices, allowing users to access only the designated examination interface. This prevents any distractions or cheating attempts during examinations.

- **Intuitive User Interface**: The application features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for both administrators and candidates to navigate.

- **Customization**: Administrators can customize the application settings to suit the specific requirements of their examinations, including background themes, branding, and access controls.

- **Exam Session Management**: The app allows for efficient management of examination sessions, enabling administrators to start, pause, or conclude exams with ease.

- **Security and Integrity**: LEAP Examination App ensures the security and integrity of the examination process by restricting access to external websites, applications, and system functions.

- **Reporting and Monitoring**: The app provides real-time monitoring and reporting features, allowing administrators to track candidate activities during examinations and generate reports for analysis.
